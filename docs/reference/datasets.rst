**DATASETS**
============

All datasets are subclasses of :class:`tonic.datasets.Dataset` and need certain methods implemented: ``__init__``,  ``__getitem__`` and ``__len__``. This design is inspired by torchvision's way to provide datasets.

Events for a sample in both audio and vision datasets are output as structured numpy arrays of shape (N,E), where N is the number of events and E is the number of event channels. Vision events typically have 4 event channels: time, x and y pixel coordinates and polarity, whereas audio events typically have time, x and polarity.
